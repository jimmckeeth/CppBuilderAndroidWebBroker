# C++Builder Android Web Broker

This is a standalone Web Broker app ported to Android. It has a TDataModule instead of a form, so there is no GUI. It is tested to work under Android Things and Emteria.OS on Raspberry Pi 3.

You will need to copy the following files (and possible more) from your RTL folder into the RTL subfolder to compile for Android since they are not included in the Android package:

- Web.WebReq.pas
- Web.WebBroker.pas
- Web.WebConst.pas
- IdHTTPWebBrokerBridge.pas
- IdCompilerDefines.inc
- Web.WebReq.hpp
- Web.WebBroker.hpp
- Web.WebConst.hpp
- IdHTTPWebBrokerBridge.hpp

This isn't officially supported, and only has limited testing. Your mileage may vary. 

This was developed and tested in C++Builder 10.3.1 Rio.
